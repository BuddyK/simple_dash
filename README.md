## Simple Dash
This is a simple flask for displaying information that I'm interested in.

**just for local development at this point**

Install Flask
```
pip install flask
```

Run the app
```
export FLASK_APP=run.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

I can't imagine anybody is going to use this. There has to be hundreds of thousands or repos out there like this. That nobody ever uses and somebody just worked on a couple of times... Lonely crusty old code that needs some attention. Has a glint of purpose and ambition that is likely going to flicker out at best.
